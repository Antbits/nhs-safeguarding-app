<p><a data-id="a0" href="#a0" id="a0"><b>Anyone can be a victim of domestic abuse, regardless of gender, age, ethnicity, socio-economic status, sexuality or background.</b></a></p>
<p>According to the latest Office for National Statistics data, over 20% of adults have experienced domestic abuse since the age of 16 years, that’s over 2.3 million adults in the last year alone. Domestic abuse is typically a gendered issue - one woman in three and one man in five in the UK will be a victim of domestic abuse during their lifetime. Two women a week are killed by a current or former male partner.</p>
<p>The Domestic Abuse Bill has a proposed statutory definition of domestic abuse as:</p>
<blockquote data-block-key="qq13y">Domestic Abuse is defined as “Any incident or pattern of incidents of controlling, coercive, threatening behaviour, violence or abuse between those aged 16 or over who are or have been intimate partners or family members regardless of gender or sexuality”.<br><br> Abuse can be perpetrated by partners, ex-partners and family members, including children under the age of 18, adult children or siblings. It may include one or more of physical or sexual abuse; violent or threatening behaviour; controlling or coercive behaviour; economic abuse; psychological, emotional and other forms of abuse.</blockquote>
<p>This definition includes <a href="../s3-06/index.html">honour-based abuse and forced marriage</a>, and is clear that victims are not confined to one gender or ethnic group</p>
<p>Through consultation, professionals voiced that abuse is not just characterised by physical violence and that victims of domestic abuse are often subjected to wider abuse through control and coercion permeating all aspects of their life. A new offence of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate partner or family relationship was introduced through the <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/9/contents/enacted">Serious Crime Act 2015</a>. The new statutory definition clarifies such behaviours as:</p>
<blockquote data-block-key="yi8dt">“Controlling behaviour is a range of acts designed to make a person subordinate and/or dependent by isolating them from sources of support, exploiting their resources and capacities for personal gain, depriving them of the means needed for independence, resistance and escape and regulating their everyday behaviour”.<br><br> “Coercive behaviour is an act or a pattern of acts of assault, threats, humiliation and intimidation or other abuse that is used to harm, punish, or frighten their victim”.</blockquote>

<h3 data-block-key="b0nn3" id="">Economic abuse</h3>
<p>Economic abuse includes any behaviour that has a substantial adverse effect on an individual’s ability to acquire, use or maintain money or other property, or to obtain goods or services. This can include an individual’s ability to acquire food, clothes, transportation and utilities. Economic abuse can also constitute controlling or coercive behaviour. It can make the individual economically dependent on the abuser, and/or create economic instability, thereby limiting their ability to escape and access safety. This can result in an individual staying with an abuser and experiencing more abuse and harm as a result.</p>
<p>Examples of economic abuse might include the following examples where they have a substantial adverse effect on the victim:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="ud5qv">controlling the family income</li>
<li data-block-key="9wi4d">not allowing a victim to spend any money unless ‘permitted’</li>
<li data-block-key="wm75j">denying the victim food or only allowing them to eat a particular type of food</li>
<li data-block-key="8v8xo">running up bills and debts such as credit/store cards in a victim’s name, including without them knowing</li>
<li data-block-key="2ebyw">refusing to contribute to household income</li>
<li data-block-key="luz8f">deliberately forcing a victim to go to the family courts so they incur additional legal fees</li>
<li data-block-key="nifpn">interfering with or preventing a victim from regularising their immigration status so that they are economically dependent on the perpetrator</li>

<li data-block-key="5wsqn">interfering with a victim’s education, training, or employment</li>
<li data-block-key="3mmoj">not allowing a victim access to mobile phone/car/utilities</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-block-key="2hqbx" id="">Verbal abuse</h3>
<p>Examples of verbal abuse include:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="nwz59">repeated yelling and shouting</li>
<li data-block-key="utlmi">verbal humiliation either in private or in company</li>
<li data-block-key="0k4za">being laughed at and being made fun of</li>
<li data-block-key="o916h">insults and threats; and</li>
<li data-block-key="zkyns">mocking someone about their disability, gender, sexual orientation, physical appearance etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-block-key="hg7yv" id="">Online and digital abuse</h3>
<p>Perpetrators can use technology and social media as a means of controlling or coercing victims. This happens frequently both during and after relationships with abusers.</p>
<p>Examples of online abuse include:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="g5dej">placing false or malicious information about a victim on their or others social media</li>
<li data-block-key="ct1jr">being trolled</li>

<li data-block-key="ad8jx">hacking into, monitoring or controlling email accounts, social media profiles and phone calls</li>
<li data-block-key="5lig5">using personal devices such as smart watches or smart home devices (such as Amazon Alexa, Google Home Hubs, etc) to monitor, control or frighten; and</li>
<li data-block-key="ttyqr">use of hidden cameras</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-block-key="amqat" id="">Intersectionality and other considerations</h3>
<p>Individuals can be the victims of multiple and different abusive behaviours because of the way different characteristics, such as immigration status, race, ethnicity, socioeconomic position and sexuality intersect and overlap, particularly in relation to accessing services and support if they are not adequately designed to meet their needs.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id=""><a data-id="a2" href="#a2" id="a2">Types of domestic abuse</a></h2>
<h3 data-block-key="fto0y" id="">Intimate partner violence</h3>
<p>Domestic abuse most commonly takes place in intimate partner relationships. The vast majority is perpetrated by men against women, but men are also subject to abuse by female partners, and both men and women experience abuse from same sex partners. Such abuse in intimate relationships can vary in severity and frequency, ranging from a one-off occurrence to a continued pattern of behaviour.</p>
<p>It can involve or be perpetrated alongside abuse by other family members and in extended family households or settings, particularly where the victim is living with the perpetrator’s family. Abuse often continues even when a relationship has ended, which can be a significantly dangerous time for a victim. Post-separation abuse, including stalking, harassment and forms of physical, emotional, sexual and economic abuse often continues and causes ongoing harm.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="wn4sv" id="">Abuse by family members</h3>
<p>Abuse within a family set up can encompass a number of different behaviours. A wide range of family members will be considered to be “relatives” that can perpetrate and be victims of abuse.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="9i0bs" id="">Teenage relationship abuse</h3>
<p>Relationship abuse happens at all ages, not just in adult relationships: latest figures show that men aged between 16-19 were most likely to experience domestic abuse than any other age group; women aged between 16-19 were more likely to experience domestic abuse than those aged over 25.</p>
<p>Domestic abuse in teenage relationships is just as severe and has the potential to be as life threatening as abuse in adult relationships. Young people may experience a complex transition from childhood to adulthood, which impacts on behaviour and decision making. It may impact on the way that they respond to abuse as well as the way that they engage with services. Additionally, they may be unequipped to deal with the practical problems such as moving home to escape the abuse or managing their own finances. As a result, young people who experience domestic abuse do so at a particularly vulnerable point in their lives.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="t2nws" id="">Adolescent to parent violence and abuse</h3>
<p>Adolescent to Parent Violence and Abuse (APVA) is increasingly recognised as a form of domestic abuse.</p>
