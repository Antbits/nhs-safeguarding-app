<h2 id="the-mental-capacity-act-(mca)-2005"><a data-id="a0" href="#a0" id="a0">The Mental Capacity Act (MCA) 2005</a></h2>
<p>Mental capacity means being able to make your own decisions. <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2005/9/contents">The Mental Capacity Act 2005</a> (MCA) aims to ensure that individuals participate as fully as possible in all decisions relating to them.</p>
<p>It protects those who cannot make their own decisions about a particular matter for any reason whether temporary or permanent. It applies to people aged 16 years and over. A person’s mental capacity (ability) may vary over time and/or may depend on the type of decision that needs to be made.</p>
<p>Anyone caring for or supporting an individual may assess capacity where they are the person proposing the intervention. The assessment must be specific to the decision that needs to be made, at the time the decision needs to be made. Mental capacity is therefore time and decision specific, not a fixed notion of a person’s overall competence.</p>
<p>For health and care interventions and medical decisions, informed consent is always needed for treatment or examination; the doctor or healthcare professional who is proposing the intervention will have to <b>assure themselves</b> whether or not the person has capacity (ability) to give (or withhold) informed consent to the proposed intervention. Therefore ‘Consent’ and ‘Capacity’ can be viewed as two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="the-5-principles-of-the-mental-capacity-act"><a data-id="a1" href="#a1" id="a1">The 5 principles of the Mental Capacity Act</a></h2>
<p></p>
<img src="../../default/media/five_principles.png"><p></p>
<ol>
<li data-block-key="gmpcs">A presumption of capacity</li>
<li data-block-key="n0yml">Individuals are supported to make their own decision</li>
<li data-block-key="giyys">Unwise decisions</li>
<li data-block-key="u80wz">Best interests</li>
<li data-block-key="vlp5y">Less restrictive option</li>
</ol>
<p>These are as follows:</p>
<h3 data-block-key="lci9u" id="1.-presumption-of-capacity">1. Presumption of capacity</h3>
<p>Start off by thinking that everyone can make their own decisions. Ask yourself, “does it appear that this person can make this decision?” Are you assured that they have understood? If not, apply principle 2 (below).</p>
<h3 data-block-key="05d86" id="2.-being-supported-to-make-their-own-decisions">2. Being supported to make their own decisions</h3>
<p>Give the person all the support you can to help them make decisions. To justify an intervention, you must show that you have taken all practicable and realistic steps to help them to make the decision; such as explaining the risks and benefits to help them to make an informed choice and decide whether to give or withhold their consent. This might also include using a different form of communication, treating a medical condition which may be affecting the persons capacity (such as a urinary tract infection), or a structured learning programme to improve the persons capacity.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="gwf5p" id="3.-unwise-decisions-do-not-necessarily-mean-lack-of-capacity">3. Unwise decisions do not necessarily mean lack of capacity</h3>
<p>Keep in mind that just because the person has made a choice in one area of their lives that seems to you unwise it doesn’t automatically mean that they lack capacity in a different choice at a different time.</p>
<blockquote data-block-key="u1xrj">Remember: one person’s seemingly unwise decision is another person’s calculated risk. However; if you have tried all practicable steps to support them to make the choice themselves, they are unlikely to regain capacity and/or the decision cannot be delayed, and support has not been successful then apply principles 4 and 5 (below).</blockquote>
<h3 data-block-key="ziut3" id="4.-decisions-must-be-taken-in-the-person's-best-interests">4. Decisions must be taken in the person’s best interests</h3>
<p>Anytime someone does something, or decides for someone who lacks capacity, it must be in the person’s best interests. The MCA provides a non-exhaustive checklist of factors that decision-makers must work through in deciding what is in a person’s best interests:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="jgcv7">find out the person’s views, wishes, feelings and beliefs</li>
<li data-block-key="46lhg">encourage participation</li>
<li data-block-key="pzj7a">identify all relevant circumstances</li>
<li data-block-key="pv1mg">consult others (anyone engaged in caring for the person, close relatives, friends or others who take an interest in the person’s welfare) with the consent of the person</li>
</ul>
<blockquote data-block-key="nfhzs">Remember: In law, the role of ‘next of kin’ does not confer consent giving rights. Any best interest decision must be in the person’s best interest NOT solely the best interest of services or family or professionals.</blockquote>
<h3 data-block-key="2psb4" id="5.-carefully-consider-actions-to-ensure-the-less-restrictive-option-is-taken">5. Carefully consider actions to ensure the less restrictive option is taken</h3>
<p>The decision maker should always consider whether it is possible to provide the intervention or support in a less restrictive way. Is there a less restrictive and or intrusive option that will achieve the desired outcome?</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="mental-capacity-assessments"><a data-id="a2" href="#a2" id="a2">Mental capacity assessments</a></h2>
<p>The starting point must always be to assume that a person has the capacity (ability) to make a specific decision, unless it can be established that they lack capacity. The person does not have to ‘prove’ they have capacity.</p>
<p>A person’s capacity must always be assessed specifically in terms of their capacity to make a decision at the time it needs to be made.</p>
<p>You must treat everyone equally. You cannot decide that someone lacks capacity based upon assumptions regarding age, appearance, about their condition or behaviour. For example; any scars, features linked to Down’s syndrome, muscle spasms caused by cerebral palsy, as well as aspects of appearance like skin colour, tattoos and body piercings, or the way people choose to dress (including religious dress).</p>
<p>The person must be placed at the very heart of the decision-making process. It is important to take all practicable steps to try and support and help people decide for themselves.</p>
<p><b>Anyone assessing someone’s capacity to make a decision for themselves should use the two-stage test of capacity.</b></p>
<p><b>One</b> – The first question you must answer is: "Does the person have an impairment of the mind or brain, or is there some sort of disturbance affecting the way their mind or brain works?"</p>
<p>(It doesn’t matter whether the impairment or disturbance is temporary or permanent.) Many factors can affect a person’s capacity such as:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="f1l8b">acquired brain injury</li>
<li data-block-key="5zqjr">learning disability</li>
<li data-block-key="em9dw">mental Illness</li>
<li data-block-key="9rbdv">dementia</li>
<li data-block-key="7v9lo">effects of alcohol or drug misuse as well as some prescription medications</li>
<li data-block-key="492da">capacity can also be affected by other illness, trauma or other factors</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Two</b> – If so, the second question you must answer is; "Does that impairment or disturbance mean that the person is unable to make the decision in question at the time it needs to be made?"</p>
<h3 data-block-key="fjizl" id="what-proof-of-lack-of-capacity-does-the-act-require">What proof of lack of capacity does the Act require?</h3>
<p>Anybody who claims that a person lacks capacity should be able to show on the <i>balance of probabilities</i>, that the person lacks capacity to make a particular decision, at the time it needs to be made. This means being able to show that it is more likely than not that the person lacks the capacity to make the decision in question at the time it needs to be made. The person does not have to ‘prove’ that they have capacity.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="vkka8" id="assessing-ability-to-make-a-decision">Assessing ability to make a decision</h3>
<p>This can be broken down into three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li data-block-key="1nb4f">Is the person unable to make the decision?</li>
<li data-block-key="xt3vc">Is there an impairment or disturbance in the functioning of the person’s mind or brain?</li>
<li data-block-key="5os5j">Is the person’s inability to make the decision because of the impairment or disturbance?</li>
</ol>
<p>Another useful way to look at assessing a person’s ability to make a decision is to ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="lqbte">“Can the person make this decision at the time it needs to be made?”<br> If the answer is ‘<b>Yes</b>’ that is the end of the process and you respect what they have decided, even if the decision appears to be ‘unwise’ such as withholding consent to medical treatment. Where the answer is either ‘<b>no</b>’ or ‘<b>don’t know</b>’ ask yourself;</li>
<li data-block-key="v092m">“What appropriate help and support to make the decision should be given?”<br> This could be through providing information in a simpler way, such as using easier words or pictures, trying at different times of the day or when they are in better health or having a family member, friend or an independent person or advocate to help them express their choice.</li>
</ul>
<p>A person is unable to make a decision if they cannot:</p>
<ol>
<li data-block-key="864q2">
<b>Understand</b> information about the decision to be made (the Act calls this ‘relevant information’) including understanding the likely consequences of making, or not making the decision.</li>
<li data-block-key="akdgx">
<b>Retain</b> that information in their mind (long enough to make the decision).</li>
<li data-block-key="bz6c9">
<b>Weigh</b> or use that information as part of the decision-making process, or</li>
<li data-block-key="tqbne">
<b>Communicate</b> their decision (by any means).</li>
</ol>
<p><b>The ﬁrst three should be applied together</b>; ideally in the form of conversation. If a person cannot do any of these three things, they will be judged as unable to make the decision, at the time it needs to be made.</p>
<p>The fourth only applies in situations where people cannot communicate their decision in any way, whether by talking, using sign language or any other means.</p>
<p><b>Ask yourself:</b></p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="zjk90">“Can the family, friend, carer or advocate support the person’s communication?”</li>
<li data-block-key="bu3cp">“Would the services of a Speech and Language Therapist (SaLT) be helpful?”</li>
</ul>
<p><b>In conclusion, ask yourself:</b></p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="vie9u">“Does the person have general understanding of what decision they need to make and why they need to make it?”</li>
<li data-block-key="xgsvo">“Does the person have a general understanding of the likely consequences of making, or not making, this decision?”</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2 id="understanding-information-about-the-decision-to-be-made"><a data-id="a3" href="#a3" id="a3">Understanding information about the decision to be made</a></h2>
<p>It is important not to assess someone’s understanding before they have been given relevant information about a decision. Every effort must be made to provide information in a way that is most appropriate to help the person to understand. Quick or partial explanations are not acceptable unless the situation is urgent.</p>
<p>Relevant information includes:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="enw3w">the nature of the decision</li>
<li data-block-key="iwvud">the reason why the decision is needed, and</li>
<li data-block-key="gvr2i">the likely effects of deciding one way or another or making a decision at all</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of effective communication to support the person understand the relevant information include:</p>
<ol>
<li data-block-key="weg7p">A person with a learning disability may need somebody to read information to them. They might also need illustrations to help them to understand what is happening. Or, they might stop the reader to ask what things mean. It might also be helpful for them to discuss information with an advocate.</li>
<li data-block-key="t72ou">A person with anxiety or depression may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to reach a decision about treatment in a group meeting with professionals. They may prefer to read the relevant documents in private. This way they can come to a conclusion alone and ask for help if necessary.</li>
<li data-block-key="smehs">Someone who has a brain injury might need to be given information several times. It will be necessary to check that the person understands the information. If they have difﬁculty understanding, it might be useful to present information in a different way (for example, different forms of words, pictures or diagrams). Written information, audiotapes, videos and posters can help people remember important facts.</li>
</ol>
<p>It is only after all practicable steps to support the person to understand have been unsuccessful can you look at taking the decision for the person in their best interest. You cannot make a best interest decision for someone who has the capacity to make the decision themselves.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="is-the-decision-in-the-persons-best-interest"><a data-id="a4" href="#a4" id="a4">Is the decision in the persons best interest?</a></h2>
<p>Although there is no single definition of what would be in a person’s best interests, the Code of Practice gives a non-exhaustive checklist of things that must be considered when another person is making a decision. You need to weigh up these factors in order to work out what is in the persons best interest.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="x5mld" id="assess-whether-the-person-might-regain-capacity">Assess whether the person might regain capacity</h3>
<p>For example, after receiving medical treatment. If they might, could the decision be postponed? If so, do so.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="scee6" id="encourage-participation">Encourage participation</h3>
<p>Do whatever's possible to encourage and support the person to take part and as far as they're able. At its heart the MCA is an empowering piece of legislation.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="j9rz8" id="find-out-the-person's-views">Find out the person's views</h3>
<p>Including their past and present wishes and feelings - these may have been expressed in writing or through behaviours or habits.</p>
<p>Any beliefs or values – e.g. religious, cultural, moral and political that may influence the decision.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="a8rc7" id="identify-all-relevant-circumstances">Identify all relevant circumstances</h3>
<p>Try to identify the things the individual lacking capacity would take into account if they were making the decision themselves.</p>
<p>It is not substitute decision making which is where you put yourself in the situation and ask yourself, “if this was me what would I choose?”</p>
<h3 data-block-key="ywal9" id="avoid-discrimination">Avoid discrimination</h3>
<p>Don't make assumptions on the basis of age, appearance, condition or behaviour.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="8gejn" id="consult-others">Consult others</h3>
<p>If it is practical to do so, consult other people for their views about the persons best interest. In particular consult with:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="ure91">close relatives, friends or others who take an interest in their welfare</li>
<li data-block-key="3vh0p">anyone named by the individual</li>
<li data-block-key="jxwlo">Lasting Power of Attorney</li>
<li data-block-key="fpq67">deputy appointed by the Court of Protection</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h2 id="what-else-do-you-need-to-consider"><a data-id="a5" href="#a5" id="a5">What else do you need to consider?</a></h2>
<h3 data-block-key="lch0v" id="consent-for-treatment">Consent for treatment</h3>
<p>Before any treatment or intervention on offer can be given to a person, legal authorisation must be obtained, ask yourself, “Under what legal framework?” For most this will be the authority of their informed consent. Remember, even where a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA) for health and welfare is in place, do not assume that the person cannot consent to the particular decision at the time it needs to be made. Supported decision making remains, especially for clinical decisions.</p>
<h3 data-block-key="pp3pl" id="avoid-restricting-the-persons-rights">Avoid restricting the persons rights</h3>
<p>See if there are other options that may be less restrictive.</p>
<p>If restraint is being considered, there needs to be a reasonable belief that it is <b>necessary</b> in order to prevent harm to the person. It needs to be a <b>proportionate</b> response to the likelihood of the person suffering harm, and the seriousness of that harm.</p>
<p>Always consider if this could be a deprivation of the persons liberty and ask yourself:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="nocyc">"Does the action conflict with a decision that has been made by a Lasting Power of Attorney?" (Health and Well-being and/or Finance and Property)</li>
<li data-block-key="qxkyk">"Or court appointed deputy under their powers?"</li>
</ul>

<h3 data-block-key="kmc0l" id="the-mca-code-of-practice">The MCA code of practice</h3>
<p>Professionals and carers must have regard to the Code and record reasons for assessing capacity or best interests. If anyone decides to depart from the Code, they must record their reasons for doing so.</p>
<p>The code is at the time of writing (November 2020) which will introduce the Liberty Protection Safeguards (LPS) scheme to replace the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (DoLS) scheme.</p>
