<h1>PREVENT in the NHS</h1>
<div class="raw_html"><blockquote>
<p>PREVENT – stop people becoming terrorists and supporting violent extremism:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pursue</strong> – stop terrorist attacks and citizens of noted interest</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect</strong> – strengthen overall protection against terrorist attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare</strong> – where we cannot stop an attack, mitigate its impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
<p>The specific PREVENT objectives that relate to healthcare services are to:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="clvwu">support individuals who are vulnerable to being groomed into becoming terrorists, or are already being groomed by violent extremists</li>
<li data-block-key="yfl86">disrupt those who promote violent terrorism and support the places where they operate</li>
<li data-block-key="elpf0">address the grievances which radicalisers are exploiting</li>
</ul>
<h3 data-block-key="ykopg" id="but-how-does-this-happen-in-reality">But how does this happen in reality?</h3>
<p>The NHS is complex; a trusted-brand with many interconnected parts:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="g7i8d">our GP or practice nurse we visit for our vaccinations and such like</li>
<li data-block-key="exy90">our community pharmacy we visit ever 28 days to pick up our medication</li>
<li data-block-key="64a94">our NHS dentist we visit annually</li>
<li data-block-key="ceil6">our outpatient department receptionist, nurse or doctor</li>
<li data-block-key="ckw3r">our mental health team</li>
<li data-block-key="4jdvn">our learning disability key worker</li>
<li data-block-key="txnpw">our porter whilst they are taking us for an investigation</li>
<li data-block-key="lwmsi">our ward nurse or care assistant who is looking after us in the hospital or nursing home</li>
<li data-block-key="sfzaw">our district nurse who comes twice a week to dress our leg ulcer</li>
<li data-block-key="r2yim">our health visitor</li>
<li data-block-key="1w4tn">our school nurse</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone of these contact points can be the trigger that allows someone to voice concerns about someone becoming radicalised. Or it can be the moment when these diligent staff hear or see someone which indicates possible radicalisation.</p>
<p>The Prevent programme supports individuals who are vulnerable to being groomed into becoming terrorists or are already being groomed by violent extremists. It disrupts those who promote violent terrorism and support the places where they operate and addresses the grievances which radicalisers are exploiting.</p>
