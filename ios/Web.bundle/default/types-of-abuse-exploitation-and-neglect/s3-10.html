<h1>Tackling serious violence</h1>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
<p>The Government’s <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/serious-violence-strategy">Serious Violence Strategy</a>, published in April 2018, represents a step change in the way we think and respond to serious violence, establishing a new balance between prevention and law enforcement.</p>
<p>The strategy was published in response to increases in knife and gun crime and homicide across England and is framed on <b>4 key themes</b>:</p>
<ol>
<li data-block-key="tb21q">Tackling county lines and misuse of drugs</li>
<li data-block-key="boty9">Early intervention and prevention</li>
<li data-block-key="m6i6s">Supporting communities and partnerships, and</li>
<li data-block-key="iexfb">An effective law enforcement and criminal justice response</li>
</ol>
<p>We need to use <b>Contextual Safeguarding and Trauma Informed Practice</b> to tackle exploitation and serious violence as these impact the same families.</p>
<p>From a violence prevention perspective, the World Health Organisation provides a four-step model underpinned by the following principles that a public health approach should be:</p>
<ol>
<li data-block-key="ltthm">Focused on a defined population, often with a health risk in common with and for communities</li>
<li data-block-key="8kw2z">Not constrained by organisational or professional boundaries</li>
<li data-block-key="hi6ff">Focussed on generating long term as well as short term solutions</li>
<li data-block-key="qfotu">Based on data and intelligence to identify the burden on the population, including any inequalities and rooted in evidence of effectiveness to tackle the problem</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several different “Public Health Approaches” to tackling serious violence which have been in place for several years. The Cure Violence Approach and the Glasgow Violence Reduction Unit consider <i>violence as a contagious infectious disease which spreads between people, reproducing itself and shifting group norms</i>.</p>
<p>They propose that this explains why one locality might see more stabbings or shootings than another area with many of the same social problems.</p>
<h2 id="">The CAPRICORN Approach - a public health approach to policing</h2>
<p>Collaborative approaches to preventing offending and re-offending by children (CAPRICORN) sets out a framework to help local authorities prevent young people offending and re-offending, by looking at primary (or ‘upstream’) causes of offending, as well as secondary (or ‘downstream’) causes.</p>
<p>CAPRICORN’s focus is to describe some actions that local partnerships can take to prevent young people offending and re-offending at individual, family and community level.</p>
