<p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/729914/Working_Together_to_Safeguard_Children-2018.pdf">Working Together to Safeguard Children</a> stipulates that information must be shared with the Local Authority Designated Officer (LADO) where it is considered that a member of health staff poses a risk to children or might have committed a criminal offence against one or more children.</p>
<h2 id="involving-the-abuse-of-adults-people-in-a-position-of-trust">Involving the abuse of adults – People in a Position of Trust</h2>
<p>It is a requirement of the <a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/23/contents/enacted">Care Act</a> that safeguarding adult boards (SABs) should establish and agree a framework and process for any organisation to respond to allegations against anyone who works (in either a paid or an unpaid capacity) with adults with care and support needs.</p>
<p>These individuals are known as <b>People in a Position of Trust</b> (PiPoT). That framework and process applies to all the SABs partner agencies including health, so that the SAB responds appropriately to allegations.</p>
<p>Where there is an allegation that a member of staff in an Integrated Care Board (ICB) or primary care service has abused or neglected an adult in their personal life, the designated professional for safeguarding adults in the ICB should be informed.</p>
