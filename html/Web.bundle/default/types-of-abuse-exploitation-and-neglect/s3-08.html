<h1>PREVENT in the NHS</h1>
<div class="paragraph"><p>The aim of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/counter-terrorism-strategy-contest">UK CONTEST</a> strategy is to reduce the risk to the UK and its interests overseas from terrorism, so that people can go about their lives freely and with confidence.</p></div>
<div class="raw_html"><blockquote>
<p>PREVENT – stopping people from supporting violent extremism and becoming terrorists is one of four separate strands to the CONTEST strategy. The other elements are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Pursue</strong> – stop terrorist attacks from happening
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Protect</strong> – strengthen overall protection against terrorist attacks</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prepare</strong> – where we cannot stop an attack, mitigate its impact</p>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The specific PREVENT objective that relate to healthcare services is safeguarding and supporting those at most risk of radicalisation through early intervention, identifying them and offering support.</p>
<p>The NHS is complex; a trusted brand with many interconnected parts:</p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="ahojm">our GP or practice nurse we visit for our vaccinations and such like</li>
<li data-block-key="e6vol">our community pharmacy we visit every 28 days to pick up our medication</li>
<li data-block-key="e3q2l">our NHS dentist we visit annually</li>
<li data-block-key="8jm05">our outpatient department receptionist, nurse or doctor</li>
<li data-block-key="djtpd">our mental health teams</li>
<li data-block-key="enn3t">our learning disability key worker</li>
<li data-block-key="7rps">our porter whilst they are taking us for an investigation</li>
<li data-block-key="39eop">our ward nurse or care assistant who is looking after us in the hospital or nursing home</li>
<li data-block-key="d2rmr">our district nurse who comes twice a week to dress our leg ulcer</li>
<li data-block-key="f5jg8">our health visitor</li>
<li data-block-key="es2kt">our school nurse</li>
</ul>
<p>Anyone of these contact points can be the trigger that allows someone to voice concerns about someone who may be at risk of being radicalised. Or it can be the moment when these diligent staff notice something which indicates that someone may be on a pathway to an extremist mindset.</p>
<p>Prevent does not require the health sector to do anything new - we are already required to safeguard vulnerable individuals from exploitation. It’s about being alert to any concerning behaviours, trusting your professional instinct and voicing your concerns.</p>
