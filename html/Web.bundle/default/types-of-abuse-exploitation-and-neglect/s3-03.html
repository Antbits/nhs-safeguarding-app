<b>It's never historic.</b><br><br>Child sexual abuse and exploitation is blending together into a new cross-Government programme of work.</blockquote>
<p>We need to understand the voice of victims and survivors that this is never historic – adults of 80 can still recall the trauma of child sexual abuse at 8.</p>
<h2 id="the-independent-inquiry-into-child-sexual-abuse-(iicsa)">The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA)</h2>
<p>The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA) was established by the Home Secretary in 2015 to look at the extent to which institutions in England and Wales have discharged their duty to protect children from sexual abuse.  Its independence meant that the Inquiry was not part of any government department. </p>
<p>The Inquiry's remit was wide-ranging, but as a statutory inquiry it had the unique authority to compel witnesses and request any material necessary to investigate where institutions failed to protect children in their care.</p>
<p>In identifying what must be done differently, it built the case for change and improvements in how institutions must protect children.</p>
<p>The final statutory report was published in October 2022 by the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (the Inquiry). The report sets out the main findings about the extent to which State and non-State institutions failed in their duty of care to protect children from sexual abuse and exploitation and makes recommendations for reform. It draws on the Inquiry’s 15 investigations and 19 related investigation reports, the Interim Report of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and 41 other Inquiry reports and publications. The final report from the Inquiry is available at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/iicsa-report-of-the-independent-inquiry-into-child-sexual-abuse">IICSA: report of the Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a>.</p>
<p>We are beginning to understand the mindset of perpetrators and this is sensitive – we must be ready to react to anyone who might be indicating signs of possible or probable child sexual abuse and act accordingly.</p>
