<p><b>Ask</b></p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="1299d">the organisation asks people about their experiences, and makes it easy for people to share them by making the reasonable adjustments needed</li>
<li data-block-key="f0dil">the organisation makes sure that the person, their family or advocate know how to give feedback, raise a concern or make a complaint</li>
<li data-block-key="a2usc">and that people feel able to speak up when they have feedback, a concern or complaint</li>
<li data-block-key="d1son">everyone knows when a concern or complaint is a safeguarding or a criminal issue, and what must happen</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Listen</b></p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="6d0be">the organisation really listens to what has been said and is not defensive</li>
<li data-block-key="f7vrg">the organisation and staff have the skills to listen and understand what it feels like from the person’s perspective</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Do</b></p>
<ul>
<li data-block-key="fvg3s">the organisation does something positive about it in good time and says what it is doing to put it right, in a clear way that is right for that person</li>
<li data-block-key="2odur">the organisation learns from the concern or complaint and changes things so the service can improve</li>
<li data-block-key="2vo8b">the organisation proactively looks at ways to improve by working with the people that use services, listening to and learning from their experiences – in co-production<br>
</li>

<ul>
<li data-block-key="7eqlf">the NHS Constitution, equality and human rights laws say everyone has the right to good quality services, person-centred care and support</li>
<li data-block-key="bbabv">it means doing things differently for people with a learning disability, autism or both – so people of all ages have the best chance of good outcomes and equal access to services</li>
<li data-block-key="dkcf6">you can’t do this if people are not understood, listened to, or able to raise a concern, complain or influence services</li>
<li data-block-key="4t4jm">this creates health and social inequalities – poorer health, shorter lives, harm or injustice leading to safeguarding risks and criminal issues</li>
<li data-block-key="3ul8n">it is your legal, public duty to stop this from happening</li>

<h2 id="making-sure-people-have-the-same-rights-as-anyone-else-nhs-principles"><a data-id="a4" href="#a4" id="a4">Making sure people have the same rights as anyone else – NHS principles</a></h2>
<p><b>Principle 1</b></p>
<p>The NHS has a duty to each and every individual it serves and must respect their human rights. At the same time, it has a wider social duty to promote equality through the services it provides and to pay particular attention to groups or sections of society where improvements in health and life expectancy are not keeping pace with the rest of the population.</p>
<p><b>Principle 4</b></p>
<p>NHS services must reflect, and should be coordinated around and tailored to, the needs and preferences of patients, their families and their carers. Patients, with their families and carers, where appropriate, will be involved in and consulted on all decisions about their care and treatment. The NHS will actively encourage feedback from the public, patients and staff, welcome it and use it to improve its services.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="making-nhs-values-reach-out"><a data-id="a5" href="#a5" id="a5">Making NHS values reach out</a></h2>
<blockquote data-block-key="6db22">"We ensure that compassion is central to the care we provide and respond with humanity and kindness to each person’s pain, distress, anxiety or need… We find time for patients, their families and carers, as well as those we work alongside…"<br><br> "We maximise our resources for the benefit of the whole community, and make sure nobody is excluded, discriminated against or left behind."<br><br> "We put the needs of patients and communities before organisational boundaries."</blockquote>

<h2 id="legal-and-statutory-duties-to-ask-listen-and-do"><a data-id="a6" href="#a6" id="a6">Legal and statutory duties to ask, listen and do</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1998/42/contents">The Human Rights Act 1998</a> protects everyone in the UK. People with a learning disability or autism who are subject to detention may be particularly at risk of having their human rights infringed.</p>
