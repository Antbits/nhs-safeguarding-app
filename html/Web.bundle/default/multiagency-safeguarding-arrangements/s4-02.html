<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to effectively and safely manage the referral and assessment demand for safeguarding the local population many areas have established "Front Door" arrangements such as Multi Agency Safeguarding Hubs (MASHs). MASHs are intended to facilitate information-sharing and decision-making on a multi-agency basis often, though not always, through co-locating staff from the local authority, health agencies and the police.</p>
<p>Health has a clear statutory duty to ensure provision of effective and sustainable safeguarding services for babies, children and young people.
